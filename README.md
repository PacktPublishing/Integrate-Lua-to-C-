# Integrate Lua with C++

Published by Packt


This repository contains the source code for the book `Integrate Lua with C++`.

You need to download the Lua source code and place it in the `lua` folder.

The other subfolders contain the source code for each chapter. For each chapter, the source code can be organized in one of the followings ways:
- The subfolder contains a single project. The source code matches the teachings after the chapter is finished. You can use the source code from the previous chapter to practice adding code on your own.
- The subfolder contains a `begin` folder and an `end` folder. You can use the `begin` folder to start your study, which also contains the solutions to exercises from the previous chapter. There may be also a few other checkpoint folders.
- The subfolder contains a few independent projects.
